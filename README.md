### Hi👋

I run out of words to describe myself, so here is what I'm doing.

## 📨 Contact
I'm very professional that's why I use Linkedin ([https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidjralves/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidjralves/))

I also have twitter, but I don't recommend it, seriously, it's a mess ([https://twitter.com/david_jralves](https://twitter.com/david_jralves))
